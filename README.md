## About Your Social Offers (YSO)

A prototype discount/coupon/rebate web and mobile app. My first build in my first development role. It initially started as me building it as a one-user system using just the front end and the browser's local storage.

I was asked to rebuild it but using PHP, which led me to Laravel, and an absolute mind boggling stack of new things I would be learning and building with.

It unfortunately didn't make it out of the prototype phase, but can still be interacted with. I am currently working on getting it into my own server service and hosted as my own.

## How To Use YSO

If not registered and/or logged in, you are treated as a guest of YSO. You can cruise and look, but saving and redeeming are not available.

Use the register link at the top, sign up, or use one of three social media links to do so. The next page is your choice of verifying you are you. If you manually signed up, you have the choice of text or email. If a media was used, you have to use your email only, you can add a phone number once in. Provide the number that is sent to verify yourself. You are then sent to the Sign In page.

Once signed, you have access to:

-   cruise deals
-   search the database
-   add favorites
-   email or text yourself coupons
-   use category tabs or dropdown for searches
-   use Google Maps with your search for locations
-   go to each locations collection of deals
-   and more...

All data is saved to phpMyAdmin and none is used outside of this application. Nothing is sent anywhere, only used for YSO development purposes.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
